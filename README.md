  Poster Assignment: AI
This is a poster we created as part of our [Technology Information System] course to explore the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the future of software engineering.
Key Points from the Poster:
 • AI is advancing rapidly and can automate many tasks like code generation, debugging, and testing.
 • However, AI lacks creativity, problem-solving skills, and human intuition, which are essential for software engineering.
 • Instead of replacing software engineers, AI is more likely to assist them, making development faster and more efficient.
 
 inegrity and anti corruption:
 This is a poster we created as part of our [Integrity and Anti-Corruption] course. It focuses on how media—especially investigative journalism and digital platforms—play a key role in revealing corruption and holding people in power accountable.

Key Points from the Poster:
 • Media acts as a watchdog, uncovering illegal or unethical activities in government and organizations.
 • Social media and independent platforms give people a voice and help spread awareness quickly.
 • Challenges include censorship, fake news, and political pressure, but responsible journalism can make a real difference.
